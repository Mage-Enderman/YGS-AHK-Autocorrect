  # YGS-AHK-Autocorrect
  Hello Jack's Squad if you'd like to help compile this into a usable autocorrect script that jack could
  one day link to that would be great so any help is appreciated anyhow \/

  This is an autohotkey autocorrect script based solely* on YGS

  (*The only thing so far that was not based on YGS are the parts about the word pregnant*)
