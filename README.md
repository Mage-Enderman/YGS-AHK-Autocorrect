  # YGS AHK Autocorrect Script
  Hello Jack's Squad if you'd like to help compile this into a usable autocorrect script that jack could
  one day link to that would be great so any help is appreciated anyhow

  This is an autohotkey autocorrect script based solely* on YGS

  (*The only thing so far that was not based on YGS are the parts about the word pregnant*)
  
  
  
  
  
  PS: another ahk script that is already very usable is https://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk
  And my modified version https://pastebin.com/YHFLEDSE
